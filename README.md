## <a id="introduction"></a>Introduction

SharAI is built to assist users in understanding Islamic rulings by leveraging a dataset from IslamQA.info, a reputable source for Islamic questions and answers. The chatbot is designed to provide clear, concise, and well-referenced responses to user queries, ensuring adherence to Islamic principles and scholarly consensus.

The name **SharAI** is derived from the Arabic word **"Shari'i"** (شرعي), meaning "Islamic" or "legally permissible," reflecting the chatbot's focus on Islamic legislation.

## <a id="usage"></a>Usage

Once developed, users will be able to interact with SharAI through a web-based interface or API. Here’s an example of how it might work:

```plaintext
User: What is the ruling on fasting during Ramadan?
SharAI: Fasting during Ramadan is obligatory for every adult Muslim who is physically and mentally capable. It is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. The Quran states: "O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous" (Quran 2:183). For more details, visit [IslamQA.info](https://islamqa.info/en/...).
